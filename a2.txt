🧪 Serum Lipid Profile – Winbri Life Science Doorstep Service

🔬 What is a Serum Lipid Profile?

A Serum Lipid Profile is a simple blood test that measures different types of fats in your blood, including:

Total Cholesterol – overall fat content in the blood

LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) – “bad” cholesterol that can clog arteries

HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) – “good” cholesterol that protects the heart

Triglycerides – fats stored in the body, high levels increase heart risk

VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) – another “bad” cholesterol


This test helps doctors assess your risk for heart disease, stroke, and other vascular problems.


---

📌 Indications – When Should You Get a Lipid Profile?

1. Symptoms / Risk Factors

Chest pain or heaviness

Palpitations or irregular heartbeat

Shortness of breath on exertion

Obesity or weight gain

Diabetes or high blood pressure

Family history of early heart disease or stroke


2. Preventive Screening

Adults >30 years should check at least once every 1–2 years

People with diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorders, or obesity – annual check-up

Pre-surgery cardiac evaluation

Patients already on cholesterol-lowering medicines


3. Medical Needs

To detect hidden risk of heart disease before symptoms appear

Early Detection: Finds high cholesterol and triglycerides before they damage arteries.

Heart Protection: Prevents heart attack and stroke by identifying risks.

🩸 Serum HbA1c Test – Winbri Life Science Doorstep Service

🔬 What is HbA1c?

HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin) is a blood test that shows the average blood sugar levels over the past 2–3 months. Unlike fasting or random blood sugar tests, which only give a snapshot, HbA1c gives a long-term picture of glucose control.

Normal: < 5.7%

Prediabetes: 5.7 – 6.4%

Diabetes: ≥ 6.5%


It is a gold standard test to diagnose and monitor diabetes mellitus.


---

📌 Indications – When Should You Get an HbA1c Test?

1. Diabetes Diagnosis

Helps confirm type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

Detects high sugar levels even if fasting or random tests are normal.

Doctors usually recommend the test every 3–6 months.

Excessive thirst & frequent urination

Sudden weight loss

Fatigue, irritability, or blurred vision

Slow healing of wounds

Frequent infections


4. High-Risk Individuals

Treatment Guidance – Helps doctors adjust medicines or insulin.

Complication Prevention – Good HbA1c control reduces risk of heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.

Reliable Test – Not affected by fasting, meals, or daily sugar fluctuations.



---

🛡 Prevention & Lifestyle Tips for Diabetes

Eat more vegetables, fruits (in moderation), whole grains, and lean proteins.

Prefer small, frequent meals over heavy meals.

At least 30 minutes of walking, yoga, or cycling daily.

Strength training twice a week for better metabolism.

🩸 FBS & PP2BS Test – Winbri Life Science Doorstep Service

🔬 What are FBS & PP2BS?

1. FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar):

Measures blood sugar level after 8–10 hours of fasting (no food or drink except water).

Reflects the baseline sugar level in the body.


✅ Normal: < 100 mg/dL
⚠ Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL
🚨 Diabetes: ≥ 126 mg/dL


2. PP2BS (Post-Prandial Blood Sugar):

Measures blood sugar 2 hours after eating a meal.

Shows how the body processes glucose after food.


✅ Normal: < 140 mg/dL
⚠ Prediabetes: 140–199 mg/dL
🚨 Diabetes: ≥ 200 mg/dL



🔹 Together, FBS & PP2BS are the first-line tests for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes mellitus.


---

📌 Indications – When Should You Get These Tests?

1. Diagnosis of Diabetes / Prediabetes

For people with high risk or family history of diabetes.

Detects sugar abnormalities early before complications arise.


2. Symptoms of Diabetes

Increased thirst, frequent urination, excessive hunger

Sudden weight loss, weakness, or fatigue

Blurred vision

Frequent infections or slow healing wounds


3. Monitoring Diabetes

Regular follow-up for people already diagnosed.

Helps doctors adjust medicines, diet, or insulin.


4. Other Medical Needs

Pre-surgery health check-up

During pregnancy (gestational diabetes screening)

Monitoring patients on steroids or other sugar-altering drugs



---

⭐ Importance of FBS & PP2BS

Early Detection: Identifies diabetes and prediabetes before organ damage.

Daily Glucose Profile: Shows fasting control and food-related sugar spikes.

Prevention of Complications: Timely detection reduces risks of heart attack, kidney disease, neuropathy, and vision loss.

Treatment Guidance: Helps doctors fine-tune diet, medicines, and insulin therapy.

Simple & Essential: Quick, cost-effective, and accurate test for all age groups.



---

🛡 Prevention & Lifestyle Tips for Diabetes

✔ Healthy Eating

Limit refined sugar, sweets, white rice, and fried foods.

Eat high-fiber foods: whole grains, vegetables, pulses.

Choose low glycemic index fruits (apple, guava, papaya).

Prefer home-cooked meals, avoid processed snacks.


✔ Regular Physical Activity

30–40 minutes of brisk walking, yoga, or cycling daily.

Strength training for improved insulin sensitivity.


✔ Maintain Healthy Weight

Even small weight loss (5–7%) reduces diabetes risk.


✔ Stress & Sleep Management

Practice meditation, breathing exercises.

Aim for 7–8 hours of sleep.


✔ Quit Smoking & Limit Alcohol

Both worsen sugar control and increase heart risk.


✔ Regular Screening

FBS & PP2BS at least once a year for high-risk people.

Every 3–6 months for diabetic patients.

Ferritin – Iron stored in the body.

Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) – Capacity of the blood to transport iron.

Transferrin Saturation – Percentage of transferrin (iron transport protein) that is carrying iron.


Together, these tests help doctors diagnose anemia, iron deficiency, iron overload, and related health conditions.


---

1. Symptoms Suggesting Iron Deficiency (Low Iron)

Fatigue, weakness, pale skin.

Shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations.

Winbri Life Science – EMG Test at Your Doorstep

About EMG Test

An Electromyography (EMG) test is a safe, painless, and highly effective diagnostic procedure that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and the nerves that control them.
During the test, small electrodes are placed on or near the muscles to record how well your muscles and nerves communicate.

EMG helps neurologists and physicians evaluate the health of muscles and motor nerves, and it plays a vital role in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, nerve compression, and muscle diseases.

At Winbri Life Science, we provide EMG testing at your doorstep with Neurologist-certified reports and tele-consultation support — combining accuracy, safety, and convenience without the need to visit hospitals.
