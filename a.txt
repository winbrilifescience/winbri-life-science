Winbri Life Science – 24/7 ECG Test at Your Doorstep

About ECG Test

An Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a painless, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart. Each heartbeat is triggered by an electrical impulse, and an ECG captures these signals to create a graphical chart.

This chart allows doctors to assess:

Heart rate and rhythm

Blood supply to the heart

Enlargement of heart chambers

Past or ongoing heart attack

Effect of medications or pacemaker devices


It is one of the most important first-line diagnostic tools in cardiology and is often the first step in evaluating chest pain or heart-related symptoms.



Indications – When Should You Get an ECG?

1. Symptoms that Require ECG

Chest pain, heaviness, or pressure

Palpitations or irregular heartbeat

Shortness of breath or unexplained tiredness

Dizziness, fainting, or weakness


2. Risk Factors & Preventive Screening

Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol

Family history of heart disease

Obesity and sedentary lifestyle

Heavy smoking, alcohol use, or chronic stress


3. Medical Needs

Pre-surgical heart check-up

Winbri Life Science – Holter Monitoring Test at Your Doorstep

About Holter Monitoring Test

A Holter Monitor is a small, wearable device that records your heart’s electrical activity (ECG) continuously for 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, or even up to 7 days.

Unlike a standard ECG, which records heart activity for just a few seconds, a Holter monitor tracks your heart rhythm over a longer period – helping to detect irregularities that may not appear during a short test.

It is especially useful for diagnosing intermittent or hidden heart rhythm problems that occur occasionally throughout the day or during sleep.


---

Indications – When is Holter Monitoring Needed?

1. Symptoms Suggestive of Heart Rhythm Problems

Palpitations (fast, irregular, or skipped beats)

Dizziness, fainting spells, or unexplained blackouts

Chest pain or discomfort not explained by regular ECG

Shortness of breath or unexplained fatigue


2. Clinical Conditions

Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)

Atrial fibrillation/flutter

Heart block or conduction disorders

Unexplained stroke or mini-stroke (to check for hidden arrhythmias)

Monitoring after pacemaker or defibrillator placement


3. Monitoring and Preventive Use

Evaluating treatment effectiveness for heart rhythm disorders

Assessing patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease risk

Routine cardiac screening for elderly or high-risk individuals



---

Why Holter Monitoring is Important

Extended Observation: Detects heart problems that a routine ECG might miss

Accurate Diagnosis: Helps doctors identify arrhythmias, silent ischemia, and conduction blocks

Symptom Correlation: Matches heart rhythm with symptoms like dizziness or palpitations

Treatment Guidance: Assists cardiologists in adjusting medications or planning further procedures

Preventive Health: Early detection reduces risk of stroke, heart failure, or sudden cardiac events

Winbri Life Science – Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) at Your Doorstep

About ABPM Test

Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is an advanced, non-invasive diagnostic test that measures your blood pressure continuously over 24 hours (and sometimes up to 48 hours) while you carry on with your normal daily activities and sleep.

Unlike a regular clinic or home BP check, which gives a single reading, ABPM provides a comprehensive picture of blood pressure changes throughout the day and night, helping doctors identify hidden or fluctuating blood pressure problems.

This makes ABPM the gold standard test for diagnosing and managing hypertension (high blood pressure).


---

Indications – When is ABPM Needed?

1. Suspected or Confirmed Hypertension

To confirm a diagnosis of high blood pressure

To detect “white coat hypertension” (high BP only at clinic due to stress)

To detect “masked hypertension” (normal in clinic but high at home or during activities)


2. Monitoring & Risk Assessment

To check how well BP medications are working throughout the day

To detect nocturnal hypertension (high BP during sleep)

To evaluate BP fluctuations in diabetic or kidney patients

To assess cardiovascular risk in patients with obesity, smoking, or family history of heart disease


3. Special Clinical Needs

Resistant hypertension (high BP despite multiple medicines)

Hypertensive patients with dizziness, fainting, or palpitations

Pre-surgical evaluation and long-term monitoring in cardiac patients



---

Why ABPM is Important

Accurate Diagnosis: Provides 24-hour blood pressure trends, not just single readings.

Early Detection: Identifies hidden hypertension before complications develop.

Better Treatment: Helps doctors adjust medications according to day/night BP patterns.

Prevention: Reduces risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney disease, and other hypertension-related problems.

Lifestyle Correlation: Shows how work, stress, activity, and sleep affect BP.

Winbri Life Science – LVEF Analysis by ECG at Your Doorstep

About LVEF Analysis

LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) is a crucial measure of how well your heart is pumping blood. It represents the percentage of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each heartbeat.

A normal LVEF is usually 50–70%.

A low LVEF indicates weakened heart pumping function, which may suggest heart failure or cardiomyopathy.

A high LVEF may point toward certain heart conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.


Traditionally, LVEF is measured using echocardiography, but advanced ECG-based analysis algorithms can provide reliable screening of cardiac performance. This allows non-invasive, quick, and cost-effective LVEF estimation at your doorstep.

At Winbri Life Science, we provide LVEF analysis by ECG, with reports certified by cardiologists and supported by tele-consultation services.


---

Indications – When is LVEF Analysis Needed?

1. Symptoms Suggesting Heart Dysfunction

Shortness of breath (especially on exertion or at night)

Fatigue, weakness, or dizziness

Swelling in ankles, legs, or abdomen

Persistent cough or wheezing

Palpitations or irregular heartbeat


2. Clinical Conditions

Suspected or confirmed heart failure

Cardiomyopathy (dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive)

Coronary artery disease (after heart attack or angina)

Hypertension-related heart damage

Valvular heart disease

Monitoring patients after pacemaker or ICD placement


3. Monitoring & Risk Stratification

Assessing effectiveness of heart failure treatment

Monitoring patients on chemotherapy (certain drugs affect heart function)

Pre-surgical cardiac assessment

Routine cardiac evaluation in high-risk patients (diabetics, hypertensives, elderly)



---

Why LVEF Analysis is Important

Heart Health Indicator: LVEF is a key measure of how strong and efficient the heart is

Early Detection: Identifies early stages of heart failure before symptoms worsen

Treatment Guidance: Helps cardiologists decide on medications, devices, or surgical intervention

Prognostic Value: LVEF levels predict risk of hospitalization, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest

Monitoring Therapy: Ensures treatments like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or cardiac devices are working effectively

Winbri Life Science – 2D Echocardiography (2D Echo) Test

About 2D Echocardiography

2D Echocardiography (2D Echo) is a non-invasive, ultrasound-based imaging test used to visualize the heart in real-time. It produces two-dimensional moving images of the heart that allow doctors to assess:

The size and structure of heart chambers

Pumping function (how well the heart contracts and relaxes)

Valves – movement, opening, and closing efficiency

Blood flow patterns inside the heart

Presence of clots, fluid, or congenital defects


It is considered a gold standard diagnostic tool for evaluating heart health and detecting early signs of cardiovascular disease.

At Winbri Life Science, we provide 2D Echocardiography with cardiologist-certified reports and in-person consultation with an expert cardiologist at our center.
